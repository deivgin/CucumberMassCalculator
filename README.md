The Cucumber calculator

This simple app was created for fun.
During one of my internship interviews i was asked to complete a simple logical exercise.
Unfortunately i was not able to complete that simple exercise at the time.
So i decited to code it.


The exercise:

A cucumber is made of 95% water and 5% unchangable mass.
After some time the water vaporised and now the cucumber is made of 90% water.
How much did the mass change?
